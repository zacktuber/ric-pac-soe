# Design & Technology Assignment - Make a Board Game

## Brief

Design and make an original board game.

## Overview

I decided to make a mashup game between Rock Paper Scissors and Tic Tac Toe. The reason I chose these games is because everyone probably already is familiar with them so explaining the new rules should be quick and easy to understand.

The premise of the game is to play Rock Paper Scissors using a Tic Tac Toe board. Instead of playing X and O players put down tokens with a Rock, Paper, or Scissors symbol and try to make a line three tokens all of their chosen colour. Unlike regulr Tic Tac Toe the opponent can take a space already used if they beat the Rock Paper Scissors symbol.

The symbols available to the players will be dictated by a card hand and deck.

## Design

I have use of a 3D printer and a cutting machine so I decided to print the board and use the cutting machine to make the cards and tokens.

I designed the board using AutoDesk Fusion 360. I picked dimensions that would keep the board pocket-sized.

I printed the board and divider in different colours to make it visually appealing.

I found images of Rock Paper Scissors hands on the internet and converted them to SVG using InkScape.

I used the same image to make the card deck and tokens using Cricut Design Space.
