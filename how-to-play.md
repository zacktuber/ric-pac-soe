# How To Play

## Setup

Hand each player the tokens for their chosen colour.

Shuffle the deck and deal each player 5 cards. Place the remaining cards face down on the table, this is the draw deck.

## Playing

At the of their turn a player draws one card from the draw deck and adds that to their hand.

To place a token on the board the player must have a card matching the played symbol. Once the token has been played, the matching card is added to the discard pile.

A player can place any token on any empty space. In order to replace their opponents token, they must play the appropriate Rock, Paper, Scissors token.

The game continues until one player has a row of 3 tokens (the tokens do not have to be the same symbol).

If the draw deck is depleted, shuffle the discard deck and place it face down, this is now the draw deck.

## Variations

Vary the difficulty of the game by starting with more or fewer cards in your hand at the beginning of the game.

Play with your hand on the table and visible to your opponent so you can both play tokens tactically. For instance, if you can see that your opponent has no Rock cards, you can safely play Scissors.
